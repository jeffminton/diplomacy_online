## Diplomacy Online

An implementation of the Diplomacy board game playable entirely in the browser

## TODO

The big change that will be coming next is that I will be changing the way the map is drawn so that it will no longer have to rely on the raphaeljs libraries which I'm sure are playing a hand in making the interface very sluggish. I will instead be using the HTML 5 canvas tag.
